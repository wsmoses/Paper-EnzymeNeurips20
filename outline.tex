Introduction
+ Utility
+ Related Work

Why compiler AD + is hard:
* Norm / optimizations are good \wmnote{make}
* You type analysis lest you fail \wmnote{make}

Design
 + Design forward/reverse
 + Plugin
 + type analysis?
 + optimization
 + Shadow memor
 + Calling Convention
 + Cache
 + Limitations

Implementation/Integration (What is the usable status and the interesting ideas):
 + Native AD
   - Clang
     - Multisource [analogy to LTO]
       * make a figure \wmnote{make}
     - Custom gradients (custom clang necessary)
     - //extern int diffe\_dup;
   - Julia
     - Design/JIT integratino
     - Limitations
     - Zygote limitation \wmnote{}
   - Flang
 + FF-AD
   - TF/PyTorch \wmnote{Make figure}
 + Cross language AD
 + Custom gradients

Evaluation:
 Talk about what tests/why ** 
 Figure of the scientific comp pipeline\wmnote{make}
 Figure of comparision results \wmnote{make}
 Figure/table of overall comparison \wmnote{make}
 Generationations
 
Conclusion:
 Future work: AD-specification opt
 GPU backend to generate GPU code from existing
 Take in in parallel/gpu from tapir/omp/etc
 Ham it up about don't make a new diffe programming unless you need
 cross language ad disc
 Future work: working with ML community to port phys engines/etc
