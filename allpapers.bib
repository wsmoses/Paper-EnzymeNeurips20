Zygote is designed to address the needs of both the machine learning and scientific computing communities, who have historically been siloed by their very different tools. As well as fostering increased collaboration between these communities, we wish to enable \textbackslash textit\lbrace differentiable programming\rbrace  (\textdollar \textbackslash partial P\textdollar ), in which arbitrary numerical programs can make use of gradient-based optimisation. We present and evaluate our proposed solutions to the performance/expressiveness tradeoffs in current systems, as well as our work applying AD to many common programming language features, which is applicable to work in other languages and systems.},

Automatic differentiation (AD) avoids well-known limitations in round-offs and speed, which symbolic and numerical differentiation suffer from, by transforming the source code of functions. We will present how AD can be used to compute the gradient of multi-variate functions and functor objects. We will explain approaches to implement an AD tool. We will show how LLVM, Clang and Cling (ROOT's C++11 interpreter) simplifies creation of such a tool. We describe how the tool could be integrated within any framework. We will demonstrate a simple proof-of-concept prototype, called Clad, which is able to generate n-th order derivatives of C++ functions and other language constructs. We also demonstrate how Clad can offload laborious computations from the CPU using OpenCL.}

abstractNote = {Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will have broad use and transformative effects across the Department of Energy. Accordingly, the January 2018 Basic Research Needs workshop identified six Priority Research Directions (PRDs). The first three PRDs describe foundational research themes that correspond to the need for domain-awareness (PRD #1), interpretability (PRD #2), and robustness (PRD #3). The other three PRDs describe capability research themes and correspond to the three major use cases for massive scientific data analysis (PRD #4), machine learning-enhanced modeling and simulation (PRD #5), and intelligent automation and decision-support for complex systems (PRD #6). The Priority Research Directions provide a sound basis for a coherent, long-term research and development strategy in SciML and AI. Over the last decade, DOE investments in applied mathematics have laid the groundwork for the type of basic research that will underpin key advances in the six PRDs. Such advances will build on the work from leading researchers in optimization, linear algebra, high-performance solvers and algorithms, multiscale modeling and simulation, complex systems research, uncertainty quantification, and the new basic research areas that will emerge from the pursuit of transformative technologies.},
